# CodingTime
Coding time is a desktop worker service that tracks your Visual Studio 2022 usage. If you use it for a certain period of time it conciders that you are practicing your coding skills and if your application remains closed for more than 30 seconds it creates an event in your personal Google Calendar with the starting time of your coding.

You must create an "OAuth 2.0 Client ID" and download your client-secret so you can use the application with your personal Google Calendar.
